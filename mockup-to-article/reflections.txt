You've learned a lot about web development so far.
I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts
about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the
    first project to overcome challenges so far?

** What new skills have I learned?

  I've learned how to markup an HTML Document.
  I've learned to create fairly simple designs of
  a web page skeleton.
  I've learned how to format text, add images, add horizontal rules,
  and link Documents together using hyperlinks.

** What has been easy?
  Editing web pages using a text editor (atom).

** What has been difficult?
  The usual culprit is, why does it not work the way it is expected to.
  Another difficulty that I get annoyed with is Breaking down text into
  readable chunks, and managing url addresses for the same has been like extra
  pain added.

** How have I learned to solve problems using strategies from the first
   project to overcome challenges so far?

  I've made use of the best practices described in the lessons.
  I've decided to leave the MDN tab open for a quick look up.
  Matching the browser output with the project requirements outlined.
